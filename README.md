### üìñ What is SimpleDEX? {#-what-is-simpldex}


**SimpleDEX** is a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on an *Automated Market Maker (AMM)* model using the constant product formula: 

\[ 
x * y = k 
\]

Where:
- \( x \): The quantity of Token A.
- \( y \): The quantity of Token B.
- \( k \): A constant that ensures prices dynamically adjust according to supply and demand.

This mechanism allows users to swap tokens without the need for an order book, using a smart contract to manage transactions and maintain liquidity.


### Complete Constant Product Formula

The relationship between changes in Token A (\(dx\)) and Token B (\(dy\)) is defined as:

$$
(x + dx) \cdot (y - dy) = k
$$

Where:
- \(x\): Initial quantity of Token A in the pool.
- \(y\): Initial quantity of Token B in the pool.
- \(dx\): Increment of Token A added to the pool (swap input).
- \(dy\): Decrement of Token B removed from the pool (swap output).
- \(k\): Constant value that ensures the product of quantities remains unchanged.

Rearranging to solve for \(dy\):

$$
dy = \frac{y \cdot dx}{x + dx}
$$

This formula ensures the pool maintains its constant product while dynamically adjusting prices during swaps.

### Pricing Formula

The price of Token A in terms of Token B can be calculated using:

$$
\text{Price of Token A} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

Where:
- $\Delta x$: Change in the quantity of Token A.
- $\Delta y$: Change in the quantity of Token B.

### üìàPrice Curve and Liquidity

The constant product curve describes how token prices change based on their quantities in the liquidity pool. Below is a graphical representation of how this curve works:

### üìå Key Features

- **Provide liquidity**: Users can add tokens to the pool.
- **Token swaps**: Enables direct swaps between two tokens.
- **Withdraw liquidity**: Recovers the tokens provided.

### üìù Requirements {#Ô∏è-requirements}

Before you start, make sure to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.18)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### üöÄ Quick Start {#-quick-start}

To get started with **SimpleDEX**, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies if skipped in CLI:

```
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys the smart contracts to the local network. The contracts are located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deployment scripts located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contracts to the network. You can also customize these deployment scripts.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your application at: `http://localhost:3000`. Now you can interact with your **SimpleDEX** Dapp.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works {#Ô∏è-how-it-works}

Follow these steps to use the DApp:

1. **Connect your wallet**:  
   Open the DApp and connect your wallet using MetaMask or another Web3 wallet.

2. **Mint Token A and Token B**:  
   Use the "Mint" functionality to generate both tokens required for providing liquidity.

3. **Provide Liquidity**:  
   Add both Token A and Token B to the liquidity pool.

4. **Perform Swaps**:  
   Swap between Token A and Token B directly using the swap interface.

5. **Withdraw Liquidity**:  
   Retrieve your liquidity along.
